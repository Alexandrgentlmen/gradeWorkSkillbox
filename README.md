# React Skillbox 

This is my thesis on web development courses. Took courses in the company Skillbox. 
My teacher was Maksim Leskin - react / redux curator.
Technologies used in development : react-hooks / react-redux / redux-thunk / redux-devtools / react-classes / react-router-dom 

and javascript libs : masonry. Used for resource requests javascript fetch on unsplash-js services of fotobank. You can go to a page with an individual photo image to see a different resolution and photographer's profile, this mechanism works through react-router 6! Also added pagination, and via npm added the masonry library for easy photo viewing! Build from create react app .
